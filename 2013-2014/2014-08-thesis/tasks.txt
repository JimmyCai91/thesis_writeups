Draft
-----
x get in all content from cvpr14 paper into a chapter, make sure everything compiles
x get in all content from nips12 paper into a chapter, make sure everything compiles
x get in all content from 281b report into own chapter, make sure everything compiles
x merge nips12 and cvpr14 intros into own section
x merge nips12 and cvpr14 related works into own section
x for cvpr14, see what's missing in method_new (vs method) and adjust accordingly
x move evaluations to own sections
x move all MDP method setup to detection chapter: have to rewrite a little bit
x add 281b report as section to cvpr14 chapter
x go over classifier training; move eval section to appendix, ensure flow, and remove all mentions of MCF (fine to leave in figures for now)
x merge nips12 and cvpr14 abstracts and conclusions
x take first holistic pass over paper, ensuring notation consistency and marginal labels
x go through slides and insert good figures into thesis
x add C-CNN as a chapter
x take another holistic pass, focusing on abstract, conclusion, and appendix
x adjust figures in style chapter

Definitely
----------
- add figures to introduction from dissertation slides
    x features.pdf
    x imagenet_tree.pdf
    x pascal1.pdf / pascal2.pdf
    - gradient_backprop.pdf (replace the old gradient fig with this)
- incorporate trevor's edits
- in related work, expand on figure 1.1 (different models of sequential feature selection)
- use lengthier related work version for the style chapter
- add marginals to style chapter
- add a more related work for detection
- add more future work discussion
    - anytime CNN
        - can add diagram for this
    - submodularity discussion
        - could add lots of equations from 270 slides -- could almost have an appendix chapter
- redo cascaded CNN figure

Fix
---
- change citation for viola jones to remove "One Microsoft Way"

Maybe
-----
- add 281b tables
- re-plot 281b results or use less plots (there's a new summary.pdf)
