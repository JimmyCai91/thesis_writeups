Draft
-----
x get in all content from cvpr14 paper into a chapter, make sure everything compiles
x get in all content from nips12 paper into a chapter, make sure everything compiles
x get in all content from 281b report into own chapter, make sure everything compiles
x merge nips12 and cvpr14 intros into own section
x merge nips12 and cvpr14 related works into own section
x for cvpr14, see what's missing in method_new (vs method) and adjust accordingly
x move evaluations to own sections
x move all MDP method setup to detection chapter: have to rewrite a little bit
x add 281b report as section to cvpr14 chapter
x go over classifier training; move eval section to appendix, ensure flow, and remove all mentions of MCF (fine to leave in figures for now)
x merge nips12 and cvpr14 abstracts and conclusions
x take first holistic pass over paper, ensuring notation consistency and marginal labels
x go through slides and insert good figures into thesis
x add C-CNN as a chapter
x take another holistic pass, focusing on abstract, conclusion, and appendix
- expand on figure 1.1 (different models of sequential feature selection)

Definitely
----------
- adjust figures in style chapter
    x give all figures short-version captions
    - move some figures to appendix
- add marginals to style chapter

Maybe
-----
- add 281b tables as tables
- re-plot 281b results
- could add submodularity lit review as appendix chapter, with disclaimer that it didn't lead anywhere
