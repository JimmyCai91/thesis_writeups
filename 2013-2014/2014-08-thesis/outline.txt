Introduction Outline
--------------------

Biological vision systems have Anytime and progressively enahnced performance.

Real-world applications also need time-sensitive performance, at different time budgets.
    For example, advertising.

Computer vision deals with lots of classes, data sources, locations for detection.

We formulate method for deploying existing vision methods for Anytime performance.

Method is based on reinforcement learning.

For detection, use heavyweight inference: actions are slow; want class and scene context.

For classification, need to be linear: actions are fast.
