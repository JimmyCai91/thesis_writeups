Introduction:
- Biological vision systems have Anytime and progressively enahnced performance.
- Real-world applications also need time-sensitive performance, at different time budgets.
    - For example, advertising.
- Computer vision deals with lots of classes, data sources, locations for detection.
- We formulate method for deploying existing vision methods for Anytime performance.
- Method is based on reinforcement learning.
- For detection, use heavyweight inference: actions are slow; want class and scene context.
- For classification, need to be linear: actions are fast.
- For region-based, need to be fast.
