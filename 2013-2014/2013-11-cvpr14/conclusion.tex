\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
We have shown how to optimize feature selection and classification strategies under an Anytime objective by modeling the associated process as a Markov Decision Process.
Throughout the experiments we show how strategies that adapt the course of computation at test time lead to gains in performance and efficiency.
Beyond the aspects of practical deployment of vision systems that our work is motivated by, we are curious to further investigate our model as a tool to study human cognition and the time course of visual perception.

Lastly, the recent successes of convolutional neural nets for visual recognition open an exciting new avenue for exploring cost-sensitivity.
Layers of a deep network can be seen as features in our system, through which a properly learned policy can optimally direct computation.
