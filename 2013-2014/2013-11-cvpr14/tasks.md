### Definite

x make sure all figures are correctly referenced in the text and have good standalone captions
x re-work language in the introduction to be less rhetorical
x revise the related work to better explain difference w.r.t [1]
- should reference Trapeznikov, Taskar, and adaptive submodularity detection work
- make sure that the abstract points out "what follows from your solution"

### Maybe

- draft figure of increasing specificity for an actual image
    - look at the predictions given at diff budgets for actual image

### Done
x re-output plots to be more readable
    x re-do imagenet specificity plot to have same axes values as the final error vs. cost plot, and get rid of the area under acc vs. specificity curve
    x re-plot imagenet prediction prevalence with a different layout
x add link to project page in a footnote on the first page
